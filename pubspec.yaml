  assets:
    - assets/images/
    # - assets/localazations/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SFProText-Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/pro/SFProText-Bold.ttf
    - family: SFProText-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/pro/SFProText-Regular.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
